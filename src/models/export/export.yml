# this is how our export will look like - inspired by dbt's implementation https://www.getdbt.com/open-source-data-culture/reverse-etl-playbook/
# basically we force the user to always create a sql model first > we execute that model and then we take the data to send it to the reverse ETL tool.
# this is best practice according to dbt and also reflects the usage of v1 > the user always creates a model first before sending data of that model to a reverse ETL tool
# that way, we can benefit from the whole infrastructure of dbt without implementing our own export parsing logic
